Content development for the PerfectFit virtual coach

## Guidelines
1. Outline of conversation, define key points of conversation.
2. Discuss outline with at least 1 other person
3. Work out the full conversation
4. Discuss again with at least 1 other person (preferably with someone else then in step 2)
5. Validate with expert (Anke, Andrea, Veronica, Eline)
6. Improve based on feedback from expert

##
* 2-4 conversations
* simple finished better than complex unfinished
* 

## Data structure
* 1 excel file per conversation
* Columns:
 - 'Virtual Coach': what the coach should say
 - 'User': what we expect the user to say
 - 'Comments': The format (free text, option selection), specific actions (read or save from/to database for example)
* 1 line per 'sentence'
* Save the file in Teams folder
* Name your file like : 'dialog2-craving-hrs-registration.xlsx' (according to the title of your dialog)
* When dialog version is 'ready', we upload to Github (this repo)
* The data structure design is emergent, so if you encounter anything that doesn't fit in this schema we should discuss
adding more columns or changing to a flow diagram (for instance if you have a lot of different branches in the dialog).
